The following fields are available in the Performance: All Storage VMs view and can be used in custom views and in reports.

* *Status*
+
A healthy object with no active events displays a green check mark icon (image:../media/sev-normal-um60.png[Icon for event severity – normal]). If the object has an active event, the event indicator icon identifies the event severity: critical events are red (image:../media/sev-critical-um60.png[Icon for event severity – critical]), error events are orange (image:../media/sev-error-um60.png[Icon for event severity – error]), and warning events are yellow (image:../media/sev-warning-um60.png[Icon for event severity – warning]).

* *Storage VM*
+
You can click the SVM name to navigate to that SVM's performance details page.

* *Latency*
+
The average response time for all I/O requests, expressed in milliseconds per operation.

* *IOPS*
+
The input/output operations per second for the SVM.

* *MB/s*
+
The throughput on the SVM, measured in megabytes per second.

* *Free Capacity*
+
The unused storage capacity of the SVM, in gigabytes.

* *Total Capacity*
+
The total storage capacity of the SVM, in gigabytes.

* *Cluster*
+
The cluster to which the SVM belongs. You can click the cluster name to navigate to that cluster's details page.

* *Cluster FQDN*
+
The fully qualified domain name (FQDN) of the cluster.

* *Threshold Policy*
+
The user-defined performance threshold policy, or policies, that are active on this storage object. You can position your cursor over policy names containing an ellipsis (...) to view the full policy name or the list of assigned policy names. The *Assign Performance Threshold Policy* and *Clear Performance Threshold Policy* buttons remain disabled until you select one or more objects by clicking the check boxes located at the far left.
