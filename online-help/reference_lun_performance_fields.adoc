A healthy object with no active events displays a green check mark icon (image:../media/sev_normal_um60.png[Icon for event severity – normal]). If the object has an active event, the event indicator icon identifies the event severity: critical events are red (image:../media/sev_critical_um60.png[Icon for event severity – critical]), error events are orange (image:../media/sev_error_um60.png[Icon for event severity – error]), and warning events are yellow (image:../media/sev_warning_um60.png[Icon for event severity – warning]).

* *LUN*
+
You can click the LUN name to navigate to that LUN's performance details page.

* *Latency*
+
The average response time for all I/O requests, expressed in milliseconds per operation.

* *IOPS*
+
The input/output operations per second for the LUN.

* *MB/s*
+
The throughput on the LUN, measured in megabytes per second.

* *Free Capacity*

The user-defined performance threshold policy, or policies, that are active on this storage object. You can position your cursor over policy names containing an ellipsis (...) to view the full policy name or the list of assigned policy names. The *Assign Performance Threshold Policy* and *Clear Performance Threshold Policy* buttons remain disabled until you select one or more objects by clicking the check boxes located at the far left.
