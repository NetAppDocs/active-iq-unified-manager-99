Health events are notifications that are generated automatically when a predefined condition occurs or when an object crosses a health threshold. These events enable you to take action to prevent issues that can lead to poor performance and system unavailability. Events include an impact area, severity, and impact level.

Health events are categorized by the type of impact area such as availability, capacity, configuration, or protection. Events are also assigned a severity type and impact level that assist you in determining if immediate action is required.

You can configure alerts to send notification automatically when specific events or events of a specific severity occur.

Obsolete, resolved, and informational events are automatically logged and retained for a default of 180 days.

It is important that you take immediate corrective action for events with severity level Error or Critical.
