The following fields are available in the Performance: All Clusters view and can be used in custom views and in reports.

A healthy object with no active events displays a green check mark icon (image:../media/sev_normal_um60.png[Icon for event severity – normal]). If the object has an active event, the event indicator icon identifies the event severity: critical events are red (image:../media/sev_critical_um60.png[Icon for event severity – critical]), error events are orange (image:../media/sev_error_um60.png[Icon for event severity – error]), and warning events are yellow (image:../media/sev_warning_um60.png[Icon for event severity – warning]).

The name of the cluster. You can click the cluster name to navigate to that cluster's performance details page.

* *Cluster FQDN*
+
The fully qualified domain name (FQDN) of the cluster.

* *IOPS*
+
The input/output operations per second on the cluster.

* *MB/s*
+
The throughput on the cluster, measured in megabytes per second.

* *Free Capacity*
+
The unused storage capacity for this cluster, in gigabytes.

* *Total Capacity*
