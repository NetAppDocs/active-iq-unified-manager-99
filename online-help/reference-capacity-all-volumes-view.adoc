The Capacity: All Volumes view enables you to view information about the capacity and utilization of volumes in a cluster. This information enables you to understand possible capacity risks and to view the configured, used, and unused capacity of volumes. Also, the information helps you to make decisions about enabling space-saving features such as deduplication and thin provisioning.

The controls along the top of the page enable you to select a particular view (for health, performance, capacity, and so on), perform searches to locate specific objects, create and apply filters to narrow the list of displayed data, add/remove/reorder columns on the page, and export the data on the page to a `.csv`, `.pdf`, or `.xlsx` file. After you have customized the page, you can save the results as a custom view and then schedule a report of this data to be generated and emailed on a regular basis.

If you want to analyze the latency and throughput of a specific object, click the more icon image:../media/more-icon.gif[], then *Analyze Workload* and you can view performance and capacity charts on the Workload Analysis page.

See xref:reference-volume-capacity-fields.adoc[Volume capacity fields] for descriptions of all the fields on this page.
