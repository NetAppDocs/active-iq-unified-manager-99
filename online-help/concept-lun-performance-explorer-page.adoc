The LUN/Performance Explorer page provides a detailed overview of the performance of all the LUNs within a cluster.

The LUN/Performance Explorer page enables you to track and compare LUN performance during a specific time period, which helps you to troubleshoot and fine-tune the performance of your LUNs.

Using the View and Compare functionality you can compare the performance of this LUN with:

* other LUNs that are on the same volume
* other LUNs that are in the same QoS policy group
* the volume on which the LUN resides

The statistics in the charts are updated after each collection period; which by default is every 5 minutes. The View statistics in selector provides an option to show statistics averaged over the previous hour. This functionality enables you to view the latency chart in support of the NetApp "`Performance Guarantee`" program.

The LUN/Performance Explorer page enables you to:

* View threshold-related issues and their details
* Track and compare LUN performance data
* Investigate and troubleshoot threshold-related issues
* Investigate and troubleshoot performance issues
