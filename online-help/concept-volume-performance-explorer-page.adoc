This page provides detailed performance information for a volume in a cluster. The title of this page depends on whether you are viewing a FlexVol volume or a FlexGroup volume.

The Volume/Performance Explorer page enables you to track and compare volume performance during a specific time period, which helps you to troubleshoot and fine-tune your volume performance.

[NOTE]
====
Root volumes are not displayed on this page.
====

Using the View and Compare functionality:

* For FlexVol volumes, you can compare the performance of this volume with:
 ** other volumes on the same aggregate
 ** other volumes that are in the same QoS policy group
 ** the aggregate on which this volume resides
 ** the storage VM on which this volume resides
 ** the LUNs that are on this volume
* For FlexGroup volumes, you can compare the performance of this FlexGroup with:
 ** the aggregates on which the FlexGroup resides
 ** the storage VM on which the FlexGroup resides
 ** the constituent volumes of the FlexGroup

The statistics in the charts are updated after each collection period; which by default is every 5 minutes. The View statistics in selector provides an option to show statistics averaged over the previous hour. This functionality enables you to view the latency chart in support of the NetApp"`Performance Guarantee`" program.

The Volume/Performance Explorer page enables you to:

* View threshold-related issues and their details
* Track and compare volume performance data
* Investigate and troubleshoot threshold-related issues
* Investigate and troubleshoot performance issues
* Launch System Manager to make a configuration change to the volume
+
The *Configure Volume* button is available if you are logged in to Unified Manager with the Application Administrator or Storage Administrator role, and when using ONTAP 9.5 or greater.

[NOTE]
====
For data protection (DP) volumes, only counter values for user-generated traffic are displayed.
