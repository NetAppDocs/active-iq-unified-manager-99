The following fields are available in the Performance: All Aggregates view and can be used in custom views and in reports.

* *Status*
+
A healthy object with no active events displays a green check mark icon (image:../media/sev_normal_um60.png[Icon for event severity – normal]). If the object has an active event, the event indicator icon identifies the event severity: critical events are red (image:../media/sev_critical_um60.png[Icon for event severity – critical]), error events are orange (image:../media/sev_error_um60.png[Icon for event severity – error]), and warning events are yellow (image:../media/sev_warning_um60.png[Icon for event severity – warning]).

* *Aggregate*
+
You can click the aggregate name to navigate to that aggregate's performance details page.

* *Type*
+
The type of aggregate:

 ** HDD
 ** Hybrid
+
Combines HDDs and SSDs, but Flash Pool has not been enabled.

 ** Hybrid (Flash Pool)
+
Combines HDDs and SSDs, and Flash Pool has been enabled.

 ** SSD
 ** SSD (FabricPool)
+
Combines SSDs and a cloud tier

 ** HDD (FabricPool)
+
Combines HDDs and a cloud tier

 ** VMDisk (SDS)
+
Virtual disks within a virtual machine

 ** VMDisk (FabricPool)
+
Combines virtual disks and a cloud tier

 ** LUN (FlexArray)

* *Latency*
+
The average response time for all I/O requests on the aggregate, expressed in milliseconds per operation.

* *IOPS*
+
The input/output operations per second on the aggregate.

* *MB/s*
+
The throughput on the aggregate, measured in megabytes per second.

* *Performance Capacity Used*
+
The percentage of performance capacity that is being used by the aggregate.

* *Utilization*
+
The percentage of the aggregate's disks that are currently being used.

* *Available IOPS*
+
The number of input/output operations per second that are currently available (free) on this aggregate for additional workloads.

* *Free Capacity*
+
The unused storage capacity for this aggregate, in gigabytes.

* *Total Capacity*
+
The total storage capacity for this aggregate, in gigabytes.

* *Inactive Data Reporting*
+
Whether the inactive data reporting capability is enabled or disabled on this aggregate. When enabled, volumes on this aggregate display the amount of cold data in the Performance: All Volumes view.
+
The value in this field is "`N/A`" when the version of ONTAP does not support inactive data reporting.

* *Cluster*
+
The cluster to which the aggregate belongs. You can click the cluster name to navigate to that cluster's details page.

* *Cluster FQDN*
+
The fully qualified domain name (FQDN) of the cluster.

* *Node*
+
The node to which the aggregate belongs. You can click the node name to navigate to that node's details page.

* *Threshold Policy*
+
The user-defined performance threshold policy, or policies, that are active on this storage object. You can position your cursor over policy names containing an ellipsis (...) to view the full policy name or the list of assigned policy names. The *Assign Performance Threshold Policy* and *Clear Performance Threshold Policy* buttons remain disabled until you select one or more objects by clicking the check boxes located at the far left.
