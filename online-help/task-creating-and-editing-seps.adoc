When the system-defined Storage Efficiency Policies do not match your workload requirements, you can create your own Storage Efficiency Policies that are optimized for your workloads.

== Before you begin

* You must have the Application Administrator role.
* The Storage Efficiency Policy name must be unique, and you cannot use the following reserved keywords:
+
`High`, `Low`, `Unassigned`, `Learning`, `Idle`, `Default`, and `None`.

== About this task

You create and edit custom Storage Efficiency Policies from the Storage Efficiency Policies page by defining the storage efficiency characteristics you require for the applications that will access storage.

[NOTE]
====
You cannot modify a Storage Efficiency Policy if it is currently assigned to a workload.
====

== Steps

. In the left navigation pane under *Settings*, select *Policies* > *Storage Efficiency*.
. In the *Storage Efficiency Policies* page, click the appropriate button depending on whether you want to create a new Storage Efficiency Policy or if you want to edit an existing Storage Efficiency Policy.
